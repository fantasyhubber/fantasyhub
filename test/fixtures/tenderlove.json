#7965 among other that I remember but can't find anymore.\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n\r\nIn SQL a `DELETE` statement is inherently idempotent. You can repeat it indefinitely, it will always succeed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand counter cache decrementation is not. So if you have 2 process following this scenario:\r\n\r\n  - Process 1 load the record\r\n  - Process 2 load the record\r\n  - Process 1 destroy the record\r\n  - Process 2 destroy the record\r\n\r\nThen the counter cache is decremented twice.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nThis patch make the decrementation on `after_destroy` so it can check the `affected_rows` value returned by the database to only perform the decrementation if a record was actually deleted.\r\n\r\nWe (Shopify) are running a [monkey patch version](https://gist.github.com/byroot/9809265) of this PR since 3 months now, and so far the problem disappeared.\r\n\r\n# Implementation \r\n\r\nSo far I'm not very happy with my implementation, but I think the only way to make it better is to make the counter cache logic happen in `destroy_row`, `insert_row` etc, instead of doing it in callbacks.\r\n\r\nBut it mean moving a lot of code, so I prefer to validates the idea before attempting it.\r\n\r\n# Non addressed issues\r\n\r\nThe counter update that happen when you change the foreign key, is subject to the same issue, but way harder to fix using this pattern. It would mean updating foreign key in distinct `UPDATE` queries before the main update, and checking the `affected_rows` for each before incrementing / decrementing the counters.\r\n\r\nSo it's feasible but again I prefer to validate the idea before attempting it. \r\n\r\n/cc @arthurn @jonleighton @tenderlove : What do you

change adds a pessimistic lock attempt before calling destroy callbacks on an ActiveRecord model. This is a work around for a race condition where a record is destroyed by concurrent processes. The record will only be deleted once, but the callbacks based on that deletion will be called multiple times. This can mess up logic like the association counter cache which is invoked by a callback.\r\n\r\nThe change adds a select call with lock => true before destroying so the database can lock the record (if it supports this mechanism). If the record no longer exists, then the callbacks are not called. The rest of the destroy chain is called so that the record will remain in a consistent state.","created_at":"2012-10-16T18:01:47Z","updated_at":"2014-04-14T17:16:27Z","closed_at":"2014-04-14T17:16:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c32dfe666707674788baa82d7b001dde3c913116","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/pulls/7965/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/pulls/7965/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7965/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/statuses/85d4ff282d044bedc70c68a09db2c5f9e9929afb","head":{"label":"bdurand:safe_destroy_callbacks","ref":"safe_destroy_callbacks","sha":"85d4ff282d044bedc70c68a09db2c5f9e9929afb","user":{"login":"bdurand","id":41791,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41791?","gravatar_id":"fd922fce44ba22e32f8b6c44dcd3a6f9","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand","html_url":"https://github.com/bdurand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":1948068,"name":"rails","full_name":"bdurand/rails","owner":{"login":"bdurand","id":41791,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41791?","gravatar_id":"fd922fce44ba22e32f8b6c44dcd3a6f9","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand","html_url":"https://github.com/bdurand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdurand/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/bdurand/rails","description":"Ruby
